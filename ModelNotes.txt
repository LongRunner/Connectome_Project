N = number of neurons
T = number of time steps total
L = number of lag periods considered

F = NxT un-blurred matrix of fluorescence

C = NxN matrix of connections ( entry i,j indicates whether node j influences node i )
B = NxNxL sparse matrix of filter coefficients
Z = NxT matrix of spike states

f | z ~ pseudof( f, F, Z, h ) # here we'll use a gaussian kernel approximation
  = 1/N(c) sum_{j=1}^{N_t} Normal( f | f_j, h )

z | B, Z, C ~ N
